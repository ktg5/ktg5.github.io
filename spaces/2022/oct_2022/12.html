                <div id="inside-window">
                    <p>if you didn't know already, i've been using a modded
                        version of Windows 11 for a while called ReviOS11.
                    </p>
                    <p>while I've had a good desktop expernice on this OS. gaming
                        has been another story.
                    </p>
                    <p>for one, I've noticed a downgrade when it came to streaming
                        and playing VR (since I've been addicted to Bonelab a lot
                        more recently). but that aside everything else had been
                        well. I'm unsure as to why gaming when not streaming doesn't
                        suck thought? I was able to run VR games a smooth 120fps
                        most of time when not streaming at recommended graphics.
                    </p>
                    <p>but all that aside, I'n going to switching back to Windows
                        10 today. if you'd like to try out ReviOS11 for yourself,
                        you can search up and get the ISO. I still like it for
                        what it tries to aim for, but unfortunately it doesn't fit
                        my resource-intensive streaming.
                    </p>
                    <p>oh yeah, and today I was suprised to feel a wet step on the
                        stairs when I was coming down for breakfast. yep, it was
                        cat barf.
