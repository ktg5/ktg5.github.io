                    <p>Well.. it's almost school time for me again.</p>
                    <p>I'll be in the 12th grade this year! and not have to worry about anymore
                        school-related bullshit (not if I go to college which I don't think I
                        really need to).
                    </p>
                    <p>My schedule for this year looks like barely going to even have school
                        since my first class is at 9:30 AM and my last around 2 PM. So that's
                        awesome.
                    </p>
                    <p>I've recently got invite into yet another private Discord with someone
                        I've been talking to for a while on my own private Discord, so I've
                        been able to talk with friends of that friend.
                    </p>
                    <p>This isn't the first time I've been invited into private Discords; I've
                        been in multiple ones over the past year (not as active tho on them 
                        than others) with YouTubers and such. But it's making me realize That
                        people don't actually think of me as a weird person or some fan to be
                        invited into this type of stuff -- trust.
                    </p>
                    <p>I also had a little operation on my left ear because of a little thing
                        that one of my doctors noticed and had to remove a bit more of. It was
                        yesterday morning that this happened and I still can't put on my
                        headphones with my left ear hurting a bit and possibly bleeding on the
                        inside of my headphones.
                    </p>
                    <p>I'm still working on that web-game that I annouced about on Twitter.
                        It's gonna attempt to be an <i>Meteos</i> IO game under the name
                        <i>mete.io</i>, somewhat inspiried by <i>TETR.IO</i>. Like said on
                        Twitter, the game will be out sometime this month for an "Open Alpha
                        Test", so stay tuned.
                    </p>
                    <p>Alright, that's enough from me; gonna go work on the game.</p>
