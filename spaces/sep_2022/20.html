                    <p>
                        today, i wanted to voice my opinions about my thoughts on Twitch
                        vs YouTube.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i'm not the first to say it, Twitch as a service is awesome, but
                        the community/staff behind it is terrible. they're a suffering
                        company that's been losing more money by the year that is ran by
                        a money-hungry company that is just it's own beast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i wish there was a service out there like Twitch that wasn't ran
                        by Twitch, but there hasn't been anything close to that in a while.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i've thought of recently switching to YouTube even know i've
                        discussed many times how YouTube has screwed me over. YOU CAN'T
                        EVEN WATCH VIDEO ON YOUTUBE WHEN STREAMING ON YOUTUBE, you need
                        permission from the people first before watching their video first.
                        this may not be true but i got a strike for it and is why i stopped
                        streaming on YouTube.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        another thing with YouTube is it's chat; it's not as unqiue as
                        Twitch, with there being channel points, community emotes like 7TV,
                        TTV, etc. there is that broswer extendion that Ludwig owns called,
                        "truffie" which is currently only for a select few of YouTube
                        streamers -- invite only (wish it was open to everyone soon).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        i might possibly try out streaming on YouTUbe sometime again this
                        week to see if streaming on there is more enjoyable or if i get 
                        another strike for something "dumb" again.
                    </p>
