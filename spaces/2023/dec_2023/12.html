                    <p>
                        There have been multiple times where I've felt like
                        <i>Twitch</i> has hit the bottom of the barrel for
                        streamers. The "Just Chatting" category has always
                        been a fucking cesspool for soft-core porn. If you
                        ever support this category, you need help, seriously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you've been living under a rock for the pass few
                        weeks, the "Just Chatting" category on <i>Twitch</i>
                        has been getting so worse to the point where there has
                        been streamers where they get basically naked, show
                        mostly the top of their body while showing a bit of
                        their... bobs... and get money.
                        <br>
                        While these streamers are probably getting paid by a
                        shit ton of people (most of them definely being
                        <i>Twitch</i> staff), the <i>Twitch</i> service was
                        designed to stream VIDEO GAMES, not be a copy of
                        <i>Chaturbate</i>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I and probably many other people have reported these
                        streamers for "Full or Partial Nudity" (SINCE THAT IS
                        AN OPINION WHEN REPORTING A TWITCH USER), and nothing
                        has been done about them.
                        <br>
                        And no surprise! Twitch has had a history of
                        "defending" these type of streamers, mainly when the
                        global pandemic hit (which fried about 50% of the US,
                        not even including when Tiktok launched). If I were
                        staff of Twitch, I believe the service would get
                        double the profit it's been getting.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wish I could just change platforms, like say Kick
                        or YouTube, but none of them come close to all the
                        features that Twitch offers for streamers & viewers,
                        at least, as of writing this.
                        <br>
                        I have and never will support the staff of Twitch,
                        they've always have made the worse decisions when it
                        comes to enforcing it's rules and who should get
                        punished for breaking them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Long story short, watch smaller streamers that follow
                        Twitch's ToS.
                    </p>
