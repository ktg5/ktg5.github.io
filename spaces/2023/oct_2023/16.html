                        Hi, it's your super active documenter, here to talk about
                        some stuff and disappear for other couple months.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First things first, I believe I can go off as a OG Xbox 360
                        user. I got myself Mass Effect 1, a founders edition of
                        Forza 4, and just recently, a copy of Minecraft. A while
                        back I did legit buy a new username, but I'll need to
                        figure out how to remove my "new format" username.
                        Don't know if that's even possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Also in this same week, I got my hands on a Artisan
                        mousepad, specificly, the Hayate Otsu. While I possibly
                        could have gotten the Artisan Hien to save some money,
                        I've seen some reviews saying that the Hayate Otsu is
                        better than the Hien, which I don't know if that's true
                        or not due to this being the first time for me using a
                        Artisan mousepad. My other mousepad I have is the Logitech
                        G640, which I'm going to keep on my desk for now; I
                        believe the G640 is better for games like Counter-Strike
                        / Valorant due to it's stopping-power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Over the past couple of weeks, I've transformed my
                        YouTube userscript into a browser extension! One of my
                        first! It's called <a href="https://github.com/ktg5/PlayerTube"> PlayerTube</a>
                        and is open for download on Chrome & Firefox browsers.
                        Check it out whenever you have the time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, I'm heading over to Japan on Wednesday! (If
                        you haven't heard from the streams) I'll be flying out
                        by 5:30 AM (yes amazing time) and will arrive
                        basically the next day, as it's a 12+ hour flight. I'll
                        hopefully be sharing some stuff through-out on Twitter
                        and after my trip on YouTube (and possibly here). I'll
                        be looking for game consoles, arcade stuff, cool
                        places to take photos, and many more.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That's all for now, 'til next time.
                    </p>
