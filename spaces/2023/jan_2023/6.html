                        It's been a moment since I've posted on here. I just kinda lost
                        the idea of writing stuff into here for a while. Not that I got
                        over-worked / forgetten about it, I just don't got much to talk
                        about, so apologizes for that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've been collecting a lot more CDs recently, my most recent
                        pickup was <i>Superrappin Mix-CD</i>. I've got a much of other
                        underground stuff to that I might show off on the secondary
                        YouTube channel soon. I'm really greatful to find this type of
                        music because there's some really good stuff in these
                        <i>Superrappin</i> albums, definely worth listening to if
                        you're a fan of <i>underground Hip-Hop</i>.

                        I've also been working on some cool stuff for my graphic
                        design class. This week we've been just making whatever the
                        hell we wanted to. So I made this...

                    <p>
                        Yeah, it's just something that came out of head. It ain't
                        finished yet either if you couldn't tell. We were told to
                        give a "story" behind it so here's what I wrote.

                        <i>
                        Alright so, it's in the middle of the world's most important
                        racing tournaments of all time, when suddenly, an attack
                        helicopter appears out of nowhere! "Oh shit!", says the driver
                        in a blue and silver race car. As the driver tries to speed up,
                        the helicopter gets closer and closer to the driver. Sounds of
                        shots from the minigun of the attack helicopter are heard. And
                        sounds of the concrete road are heard. They're after the driver
                        in first! For what? Who knows. All we know is that many more
                        people are turning in to see what happens next
                        </i>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would write up something better than that, but this isn't
                        English class, so I could care less.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometime in the future, I'm going to create a "legacy"
                        sub-website for older computers and such when I get to in the
                        future. ANd hopefully it'll be made on a computer that can
                        see how it looks.
                    </p>
                    <p>That's all I got for now, thanks for sticking around.</p>
