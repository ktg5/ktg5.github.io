                        Has it really took me the same amount of time to make a new
                        spaces post on here as it has from me to upload a new video?
                        Jesus Christ -- am I that lazy?!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyway, let's walk about some stuff I guess.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After about a year of "development", I uploaded v2 of my
                        <a href="https://github.com/ktg5/YT-HTML5-Player">YT-HTML5-Player</a>.
                        Which includes more themes, custom styling, and a
                        easy-to-access menu -- no need to open up the userscript in
                        a editor anymore!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The YT-HTML5-Player project is actually my first time making
                        user-customization, other than my future game project which
                        is releasing at an unknown point in time. For that, I have
                        to rewrite most of the game code for that game if I were
                        to release it sometime, and I have a growing pain for Pixi.JS
                        because of it (Not really Pixi.JS it self, maybe just making
                        web-games in-general).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Stuff that isn't computer-wise, I'n getting a car on Tuesday!
                        I won't tell what it is yet, but I'll most likely post some
                        images on Twitter when I get the time to.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But that's pretty much it for my recent adventures. Legit
                        nothing else has been going on from what I have said above.
                    </p>
