                        Yo, it's been another couple of months since I've posted
                        on this "side-page", so let's talk about something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I've been working on a brand redesign for my Graphic Design
                        class; Evan and I choose to redesign the <i>Canada Dry</i>
                        brand. I've never really had Canada Dry before, but I tried
                        it out about a week or two ago, and it's pretty good. I'm
                        more of a Sprite or 7-Up guy, but Canada Dry -- ain't that
                        bad.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I was also able to get my multi-streaming Twitch channel,
                        known as <a href="https://twitch.tv/noclue_x86">NOCLUE x86</a>,
                        working again. I made a RTMP server as a Windows 10 VM on
                        my main server, Sommus, and it's running pretty well. I've
                        done a total of two streams with two of my friends (the VOD
                        for the first stream wasn't saved sadly, but there's some
                        clips from it) as of writing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm hoping to release an older-style sub-website this Friday,
                        I'll make another short Spaces post when that happens. I'm
                        also hoping to work on finding people that might have the
                        Meteos Online client; going to be sending out an email to
                        an person that made a screenshot program for the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But that's all for now, stay safe out there.
                    </p>
